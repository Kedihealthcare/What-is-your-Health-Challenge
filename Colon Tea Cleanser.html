                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">Are colon tea cleansers safe to use?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">When used as directed and in moderation, most natural colon tea cleansers are safe for healthy individuals.

                            <p class="text-gray-700">Usage frequency varies by product and individual needs.

                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">What ingredients are commonly found in colon tea cleansers?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">Common ingredients include senna leaf, cascara sagrada, ginger root, peppermint, licorice root, fennel seed, and psyllium husk. These herbs are chosen for their natural laxative, carminative, or digestive-supportive properties.</p>

                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">Can a colon tea cleanser help with weight loss?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">While a colon cleanse might lead to temporary weight reduction due to the elimination of waste and excess water, it is not a primary or sustainable method for weight loss. True weight loss requires a balanced diet and regular exercise. Any weight change from a cleanse is usually temporary.</p>
