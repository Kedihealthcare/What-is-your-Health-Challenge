                    <li><strong>First Layer (Perforated Cotton Surface):</strong> Designed for ultimate softness and quick absorption, pulling fluid away from the skin instantly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Layer (Anion/Far-IR/Magnetic Chip):</strong> Often infused with these technologies to inhibit bacterial growth, eliminate odors, and potentially offer health benefits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third Layer (Air-laid Paper):</strong> Wraps the absorbent core, providing stability and preventing leakage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fourth Layer (Super Absorbent Polymer - SAP):</strong> The core of absorbency, converting liquid into gel to lock it away, preventing wetness and discomfort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fifth Layer (Air-laid Paper):</strong> Another layer of air-laid paper for reinforcement and further containment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sixth Layer (Breathable Bottom Layer):</strong> Allows air circulation to prevent stuffiness and maintain freshness, while still being leak-proof.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seventh Layer (Release Paper with Adhesive):</strong> Protects the adhesive before use and ensures the pad stays securely in place.</li>

                    Key Benefits of Choosing a 7 Layer Sanitary Pad
                </h2>
                <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The multi-layered approach offers several advantages over traditional pads:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
                    <li><strong>Superior Absorbency:</strong> The SAP layer ensures maximum liquid retention, keeping you dry for longer periods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Dryness:</strong> The quick-absorbing surface and efficient locking mechanism prevent backflow and maintain a dry feel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Odor Control:</strong> Anion or other specialized chips help neutralize odors, providing discreet protection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Breathability:</strong> The porous bottom layer promotes air circulation, reducing heat and humidity, which can prevent irritation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leak Protection:</strong> Multiple layers, including air-laid paper and side guards (though not explicitly listed as a separate layer, often integrated), offer robust protection against leaks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comfort and Softness:</strong> The top cotton layer ensures a gentle feel against the skin, minimizing chafing and discomfort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hygienic Environment:</strong> The design aims to create a cleaner and healthier environment, potentially reducing the risk of bacterial infections.</li>
                </ul>

                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">What are the key benefits of a 7-layer sanitary pad?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">The key benefits include superior absorbency, enhanced dryness, effective odor control, breathability, robust leak protection, and greater comfort and softness due to its multi-layered design. It also aims to provide a more hygienic environment.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">How does a 7-layer sanitary pad offer better protection?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">It uses multiple layers, including a perforated cotton surface for quick absorption, a super absorbent polymer (SAP) core to lock liquid into a gel, and breathable bottom layers, all working together to prevent leaks and maintain dryness.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-200">
                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">Are 7-layer sanitary pads suitable for heavy flow?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, due to their superior absorbency and efficient liquid-locking capabilities, 7-layer sanitary pads are highly recommended for individuals experiencing heavy menstrual flow.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-200">
                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">What is the Anion/Far-IR/Magnetic chip layer?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">This specialized layer is often infused with technologies like anions, far-infrared, or magnetic properties. Its purpose is to help inhibit bacterial growth, neutralize odors, and in some cases, manufacturers claim it offers additional health benefits such as improved circulation or reduced discomfort.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">How often should I change a 7-layer sanitary pad?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">Even with advanced absorbency, it is generally recommended to change sanitary pads every 4-8 hours, or more frequently if your flow is heavy. Regular changing helps maintain hygiene and prevents the buildup of bacteria.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">Are 7-layer pads breathable?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, a key feature of 7-layer pads is their breathable bottom layer. This layer allows air to circulate, which helps to reduce heat and humidity, promoting comfort and preventing skin irritation.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-200">

                            <p class="text-gray-700">The eco-friendliness of 7-layer pads varies by brand and materials used. Some manufacturers are incorporating biodegradable or sustainable materials. It's best to check the product details for specific environmental claims.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">What is the absorbency level of 7-layer pads?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">7-layer pads are designed for high absorbency, often featuring a Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) core that can quickly lock in a significant amount of liquid, making them suitable for moderate to heavy flows.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-200">

                            <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, like most sanitary pads, 7-layer pads often come in various sizes, including regular, long, and overnight, to cater to different flow needs and provide adequate coverage throughout the day and night.</p>

                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">How do 7-layer pads compare to thinner pads?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">While thinner pads prioritize discretion, 7-layer pads prioritize maximum protection and dryness. The multiple layers offer superior absorbency and leak-guarding capabilities, which might make them slightly thicker but more reliable for heavier flows.</p>
